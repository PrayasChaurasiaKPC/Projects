# Image Gallery

This web page is a simple yet elegant image gallery created using only HTML and CSS. The HTML structure consists of a series of div elements, each containing an img tag for the individual images. These divs are arranged in a flex box, providing a clean and organized view of the images.

The CSS styling adds a touch of sophistication to the page. It includes properties such as padding and margins to ensure the images are well-spaced. Hover effects and flters are also added to the images for interactivity, causing the images to scale up slightly and turned colourfull when the mouse pointer is over them.

This image gallery web page is a testament to the power and versatility of HTML and CSS. It demonstrates that even without JavaScript or other technologies, one can create a visually appealing and functional web page.
